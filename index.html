	<h1>Research Interests</h1>
	<p>
		I'm a planetary scientist in the <a href="https://www.dias.ie/cosmicphysics/astrophysics/astro-research/astro-planetary-magnetospheres/">Planetary Magnetospheres group</a> 
		at the <a href="https://www.dias.ie/">Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies (DIAS)</a>.		
	</p>
	<p>	
		I study the dazzling lights in the skies of planets like Jupiter and Saturn&mdash;the aurorae, or the Northern and 
		Southern Lights as we know them here on Earth. These light shows look similar to those 
		of the Earth, but on a much grander scale: on Jupiter, the aurorae generate more power than all the electricty produced 
		on the Earth as they shine 100 times brighter than our own aurorae.
	</p>
	<p>
		The aurorae of the outer planets are created by complex interactions between the planet's ionosphere, magnetosphere, and 
		the solar wind. The structure of these regions, and their interactions, change based on different factors, including
		the shape and strength of the planetary magnetic field, the rotation rate and orientation of the planet, the sources of 
		energetic particles and plasma, and the state and evolution of the Sun. To develop a cohesive picture of the aurorae and 
		the complicated space environments of these distant worlds, my research touches on each of these different factors.
	<p>
		My research involves comparing spacecraft data (from the Pioneer, Voyager, Ulysses, Galileo, Cassini, New Horizons, and 
		Juno missions) and remote observations (from the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra X-ray Observatory) to empirical and 
		theoretical models. I focus on improving these comparisons by using novel analytical and statistical techniques, including 
		Bayesian inferencing, data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and many others.
	</p>	
		<!-- From within the planets, these lights are influenced by electrical currents flowing along magnetic field lines, clouds of electrically charged particles spinning around the planets, and the properties of their upper atmospheres. From space, they're affected by streams of particles flowing from the Sun - known as the solar wind - as well as giant eruptions from the Sun's surface and the invisible boundaries where a planet's magnetic field meets the solar wind.

		Here at DIAS, I plan to extend my expertise to include contemporary <i>Juno</i> measurements 
		of Jupiter’s plasma environment, auroral emissions outside the Jovian Main Emission and in wavelengths other than the 
		ultraviolet, and deeper modeling of the Jovian magnetosphere. -->

	<h2>Jupiter's Aurorae</h2>
	<p>
		Jupiter displays intense ultraviolet aurorae in defined, bright arcs about the northern and southern magnetic poles. Multiple forms of aurorae occur on the planet: footprint aurora associated with the Gallilean moons; the main oval aurora resulting from the internal dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere; and the polar aurora resulting from the interplay between the solar wind and Jupiter's magnetic field. The main auroral oval-- the most consistent and, on average, brightest of these-- is my main research interest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jupiter's magnetosphere is, by far, the largest object in the solar system-- the magnetopause, or sunward side of the magnetosphere, is ~5 solar radii away from the planet, while the distance down the magnetotail can be as high as 5 AU, reaching the orbit of Saturn. The Jovian magnetosphere is dominated by the rotational dynamics of plasma generated by the volcanically active moon Io, which generates nearly 1 ton/s of plasma. The continual loading of the magnetosphere with plasma is responsible for powerful field-aligned current systems that flow along the planet's magnetic field lines into Jupiter's atmosphere. Where these currents reach a maximum, the energetic electrons carrying the current create Jupiter's ultraviolet main auroral oval.
	</p>
	<p>
		Observations of Jupiter's main auroral oval, carried out both by space-based observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and probes like <i>Gallileo</i> and <i>Juno</i> have poked holes in this simple picture. Does the solar wind really only interact with the polar aurora, or does it influence the main auroral oval too? Do auroral emission on the main oval always corotate with the magnetosphere?
	</p>
	<!- - <a name="dawnstorms"></a>
	<h2>The Dawn Storms</h2>
	<p>
		The key to discovering the role of the solar wind in the deep interior of Jupiter's mangetosphere lies in understanding the "dawn storms." Jupiter's auroral dawn storms are historically rare events which are bright enough to dominate the emissions of the entire main oval for their short, few-hour lifetimes. The most interesting thing about these storms is not their intensity, however, but their behavior: they form on the main oval, where the aurora is expected to corotate with planet, yet they appear to remain fixed in local time. This behavior is unexplained, and suggests that the dawn storms both originate in the deep interior of the magnetosphere and are influenced by the sun (or the solar wind). Reconciling these two characteristics should reveal something new and fundamental to Jupiter's magnetosphere as a whole.

	<h2>The Solar Wind in the Outer Heliosphere</h2>
	<p>
		The sun interacts with all the planets in the solar system through the solar wind, a stream of charged particles which 
		blow outwards from the sun in all directions, carrying the interplanetary magnetic field with them. Both the magnetic 
		field and particles interact with planetary magnetic fields with dramatic effects, including the aurora–which shine not
		 only on the Earth, but on gas giants of the outer solar system, like Jupiter, too. Characterizing the relationship between 
		 the solar wind and planetary magnetic fields is easiest with direct spacecraft measurements of both. Spacecraft between the 
		 Earth and Sun measure the solar wind, providing valuable context for understanding its interaction with the Earth. Unfortunately, 
		 there are no such permanent spacecraft near the other planets. Instead, models can be used to estimate the solar wind at these
		 planets; however, these models can have significant, difficult‐to‐characterize uncertainties. Here we present the Multi‐Model 
		 Ensemble System for the outer Heliosphere (MMESH), a framework designed to measure these uncertainties and attempt to correct 
		 for them by comparing multiple solar wind models to spacecraft measurements over a long time span. The final result here is an 
		improved solar wind model, with estimated uncertainties, for Jupiter.

	<h2>The Hydrogen Bulge</h2>
	<p>
		Jupiter's hydrogen Lyman-alpha bulge, or "the hydrogen bulge", is not a physical change in Jupiter's shape, as the name might imply, but an unexplained increase in the equatorial H Ly-alpha emission near longitudes of 100 deg. The emission originates in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, where winds and other dynamics should dictate its motion; instead, the hydrogen bulge corotates with the planet. Corotation is not expected for an atmospheric phenomenon and indicates some connection to the magnetosphere, but the drivers must be different than in the auroral regions, as no increased H2 emission-- which dominates the aurorae-- has ever been measured near the bulge. Many processes have been put forth to explain these fast H atoms, but observations have not yet been able to distinguish between these.
		<br><br>
		The hydrogen bulge will be imaged for the first time in decades soon, owing to our successful proposal to scan the Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) across Jupiter's equatorial regions (GO 17812). These observations will be spectrally and spatially resolved, allowing unprecedented insight into the location, shape, and drivers of Jupiter's hydrogen bulge.
